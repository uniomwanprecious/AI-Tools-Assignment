Ethical Considerations**\n","\n","**A. Bias in the MNIST / CNN Model (Image Classification)**\n","\n","The model is highly susceptible to Domain Shift Bias due to the synthetic and curated nature of the MNIST dataset.\n","\n","**Potential Bias:** The CNN is biased toward perfectly centered, clean\n","\n","inputs, and lacks exposure to noisy, rotated, or blurred digits that are common in real-world applications. This bias leads to poor generalization.\n","\n","**Mitigation Strategy (TensorFlow Fairness Indicators):**\n","\n","**Detection:** TensorFlow Fairness Indicators (TFFI) should be used to define and evaluate performance metrics (like Recall) across specific, challenging data slices, such as \"images rotated by >15 degrees\" or \"low-contrast images\".\n","\n","**Action:** If TFFI confirms disproportionately low performance on these slices, the necessary mitigation is to integrate Data Augmentation (e.g., random rotations, shears, blurring) into the training process.\n","\n","**B. Bias in the Amazon Reviews / Rule-Based Sentiment Model (NLP)**\n","\n","The use of a rule-based system (VADER) introduces risks related to contextual reliability and cultural awareness.\n","\n","**Potential Bias:**\n"," The model is highly susceptible to Lexical and Contextual Bias. The fixed VADER lexicon cannot interpret sarcasm or domain-specific jargon, causing it to assign incorrect sentiment.\n","\n","**Mitigation Strategy (spaCy's Rule-Based Systems):**\n","\n","**Detection & Action:** Implement a custom rule-based system using spaCy's Dependency Parser and Token Matcher to refine or override the VADER score\n","\n"," A rule could be built to detect negation or contradiction. If a sentence has a strong positive VADER score but contains tokens identified by spaCy's dependency structure as negatives (\"broke,\" \"return,\" \"awful\"), the rule would programmatically flip the final sentiment to Negative, introducing essential contextual awareness.\n","\n","**2. Troubleshooting Challenge**\n","This section addresses diagnosing model performance failures.\n","\n","**Challenge:** The MNIST CNN model only achieves 85% accuracy, failing to meet the required >95% goal.\n","\n","**Troubleshooting:** The first step is to check for Overfitting by analyzing the Training Loss versus the Validation Loss recorded during training.\n","\n","**Solution:** If the Training Loss decreases while the Validation Loss stops improving, the model is overfitting. Solutions include increasing Dropout rates in the CNN layers, reducing the number of epochs, or implementing an Early Stopping callback."],"metadata":{"id":"ujn0naDBKPn-"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMjwAfO2v1hbJyyh7rjE3RK"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
